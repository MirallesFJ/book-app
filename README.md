# My Book App

This is a book management application built with Angular. The application allows users to view a list of books, each with details such as genre, status, number of pages, and rating. Users can also delete books from the list.

## Project Structure

The main application component is defined in `app.component.ts`. It includes several child components:

- `NavigationBarComponent`: Displays the navigation bar.
- `HeaderComponent`: Displays the header.
- `BooksTableComponent`: Displays the list of books.
- `GoogleBooksComponent`: (Details not provided)

The application uses a service, `BooksService`, to manage the books data.

## Building the Project

To build the project for production, use the Angular CLI command `ng build --prod`. The built files will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Future Improvements

1. **Edit Book Feature**: Implement a feature to edit the details of existing books. This could include an edit button for each book that opens a form with the current book details, which can be edited and saved.
2. **Pagination**: If the books list becomes very long, it could be useful to implement pagination to make it easier to navigate.
3. **User Accounts**: Implement user accounts with login and registration. This would allow each user to have their own personal list of books.
